## Who am I?

Hey there, I'm Luke Hewitt and this is my personal site. I'm a code wrangler (yeeeehaw) from Brisbane, Australia. Here
you'll find out stuff about the things I'm working on, tutorials, opinion pieces, or pretty much anything else I wanna 
put on here :)

## My Experience

I've been deeply involved in all kinds of software development from front end to back end, steering projects from their 
conceptual stages all the way through to launch. My role in a team involves more than just hands-on development; I also
bring strategic planning and coordinated execution to the product roadmap.
