# Olympic Pulse: A Leap into AR Development

Developing OlympicPulse was a new frontier for me—my first venture into AR and mobile app creation. This project was all about bringing the Olympic spirit to life through AR tech, starting with the excitement of ticket purchase and leading up to the event itself.

## The Build-Up

As the lead dev, I merged project management with hands-on development. I crafted the app using Unity, learned the ropes of AR, and saw our concepts come to life through each Xcode build. We initially considered a web app with AR.js or Three.js but pivoted to a mobile app for its broader reach and direct user engagement.


## Team Dynamics

Leading a team isn't without its hurdles. We had our share of coordination challenges, but these became valuable lessons in teamwork and leadership. The experience taught me the nuances of guiding a team and the importance of clear communication and shared goals.

## The Finish Line

Olympic Pulse stands as a testament to the learning journey—a blend of technical skill, creative vision, and the drive to overcome obstacles. It was an enriching experience that shaped my understanding of AR and mobile app development.
