## Who am I?

Hey there, I'm Luke Hewitt, the founder and lead developer at smashit.games based in Brisbane, Australia. My passion lies in creating innovative experiences in the XR gaming space, leveraging my expertise in game development and project management.

## My Experience

I've been at the forefront of game development, web development and database management, steering projects from their conceptual stages all the way through to launch. My role involves more than just hands-on development; it encompasses strategic planning and executing our product roadmap to deliver immersive VR games that resonate with our audience. With a Bachelor of Information Technology from the University of Queensland and experience as a Systems Administrator at STCpl, I've honed my skills in software development, project management, and operational efficiency.
